    Online communities allow people from many different backgrounds to come together.
    The Jule community are committed providing an open, friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, body size, disability,
    ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, of socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation or similar.
    <br><br>
    The purpose of the code of conduct is to set a respectful, effective and productive standard of behavior for Jule contributors.
    <br><br>
    Jule needs all the users and contributors to have a good and big community and for it to be a successful project.
    Different ideas, views and disagreements are needed for development and progress.
    However, disrespect is not acceptable.
